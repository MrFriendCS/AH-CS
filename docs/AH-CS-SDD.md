# Software Design and Development

## Notes

All the code examples use Python.

These notes are focused on Advanced Higher Computing Science so some terms may be used differently.

## Objects

An object is the way of representing _something_ in software.  A string, such as "Hello", is an object.  An object will have properties and methods:

* Property - data about the object (a variable)
* Method - something the object can do (a sub-program)

### Declaration

``` python
class Person:
    """Declare a class to define a person."""

    # Class properties
    name = "Tom"
    age = 18
```

### Properties

A procedure is a type of sub-routine that ***does not*** return a value.  It must be defined before it can be used.

``` python

```

A procedure can be called from the main program, or from another sub-routine.

``` python
```


### Methods

A function is another type of sub-routine that ***does*** return a value.  It must be defined before it can be used.

``` python
```

A function can be called from the main program, or from another sub-routine.  To use the value returned by the function it can be assigned to a variable or used as the a value in another operation.
